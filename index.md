Hello! I am a backend web application developer, proficient in several languages: (`Java & Springboot` (`Kotlin` / `Scala` too), `Python`, `Golang`). 
My most recent positions have been focused on DevOps and SRE, to increase and solidify my knowledge around deployment, Kubernetes, CI & CD systems, and automation tooling.

In my free time I am a bit of a programming language enthusiast, and enjoy learning new concepts, paradigms, and tools. 
Some of the things I've been playing around with:
 - Efficient compiled programming, with `Rust`, `Golang` and `Zig`
 - Functional, and Type Oriented programming, with `Haskell`, `Rust`, `Scala`
